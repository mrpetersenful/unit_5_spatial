### Lesson 5.3: AIS ship tracks
## New functions: sf::st_crop()


## Automatic Identification System (AIS)

# Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an automatic tracking system that uses tranceivers on vessels to detect their location in space and time. AIS is used secondarily to radar to avoid vessel collisions. Large vessels and passenger ships are required to use AIS. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and NOAA provide AIS data collected by the US Coast Guard for free at https://marinecadastre.gov/AIS/

# AIS data is huuuugge!! There are a lot of ships in the water and each ping from an AIS unit is a new row of data. I downloaded AIS data from just the month of January 2017 in UTM Zone 17 (i.e., the US East Coast). This is a 4GB spreadsheet with 31,884,021 rows. This is too big to include in a GitHub repo or to effectively use in class. In the script ais_reduce.R, I read in the data, cropped it to a bounding box around FL and GA, removed duplicate rows and rows with no vessel CallSign and grabbed only vessels with the status "under way using engine". Then I wrote this much smaller file (16 MB) out to a .csv file that has a more manageable size, but is otherwise equivalent to what you could download directly from the website. 

# We can use the AIS data to get a look at the amount of vessel traffic that occurs in the Southeast US North Atlantic right whale critical breeding habitat. Much of this critical habitat has been designated a Seasonal Management Area, where vessels > 65 feet long are required to slow down to < 10 knots during the calving season (from November 15 - April 15 each year). Vessels < 65 feet in length are also encouraged, but not required, to slow down to < 10 knots. NOAA Fisheries issued this ruling to reduce the risk of right whale ship strikes. 

# Let's start by loading in the subsetted AIS data, the shapefiles for the right whale critical habitat (that we used earlier) and the world coastline data in R's mapdata package. We will crop the coastline data to the same bounding box that I used when I reduced the size of the original (huge) AIS data.

# AIS data; downloaded for January 2017, UTM Zone 17
# https://marinecadastre.gov/AIS/
# subsetted to 2017-1-25 data with script ais_reduce.R in this repo
ais_day = read.csv('data/processed_ais/ais_2017-01-25.csv')

# Coastline data
lat_bounds = c(25,34)
lon_bounds = c(-82, -76)
world_map = map_data("worldHires", ylim = lat_bounds, xlim = lon_bounds)
dim(world_map)

# Read in US critical habitat shapefiles
# https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/educational_resources/gis/data/index.html

USA_crit_hab = st_read('data/North_Atlantic_Right_Whale_Critical_Habitat/', 'North_Atlantic_Right_Whale_Critical_Habitat')

USA_crit_hab_sf = st_transform(USA_crit_hab, crs=4326)

# Now let's plot everything that we loaded up. Note that the AIS data is still quite large, with 119,726 rows. Each row represents a lat/lon coordinate where an AIS signal was emitted. Putting all of these points on a map takes some processing time, but you can significantly speed it up by never actually printing the plot out to the console. Do this by saving the plot to a variable name and using ggsave() to write that plot out to a file (like a .pdf, .png, or .jpg). Then just open up that file to see your map. 

head(ais_day)

# Plot critical habitats and carcass locations
ais_map_pts = ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "black", color = NA) + 
  geom_sf(data=USA_crit_hab_sf, alpha = 0.5, color=NA, fill='yellow') + 
  geom_point(data = ais_day, aes(x = LON, y = LAT, color = CallSign), size=2) + 
  coord_sf(1.3, xlim = lon_bounds, ylim = lat_bounds) + 
  guides(color=FALSE) + 
  ylab("Latitude") + xlab("Longitude") + theme_classic()

ggsave(ais_map_pts, filename='figures/ais_pts_2017-01-25.pdf', device="pdf", height=5, width=4)

# Now we'll do some analysis. First we can use the ymd_hms() function in the lubridate package to convert the column BaseDateTime into a date/time variable (of type POSIXct) that R will actually recognize. Then we can simply use the arrange() function in dplyr to sort our data by date/time to make sure they are in chronological order. Once that is done, we can group the AIS by each vessel's unique CallSign and collapse the series of AIS points into ship track lines. Note that arranging the data chronologically and grouping by vessel are critical steps so that the ship tracks make sense. 

dim(ais_day)

ais_day_sf = ais_day %>%
  mutate(date_time = lubridate::ymd_hms(BaseDateTime)) %>% 
  arrange(date_time) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords=c("LON", "LAT"), crs=4326) %>%
  group_by(CallSign, Length) %>%
  summarise(do_union=FALSE) %>% 
  st_cast("LINESTRING")

class(ais_day_sf)
glimpse(ais_day_sf)
dim(ais_day_sf)

# After that hard work of collapsing AIS points into sensible ship tracks, let's plot our results:

# Plot ship tracks
ais_day_line_map = ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "black", color = NA) + 
  geom_sf(data=USA_crit_hab_sf, alpha = 0.5, color=NA, fill='yellow') + 
  geom_sf(data=ais_day_sf, aes(color=CallSign)) + 
  coord_sf(1.3, xlim = lon_bounds, ylim = lat_bounds) + 
  guides(color=FALSE) + 
  ylab("Latitude") + xlab("Longitude") + theme_classic()
ggsave(ais_day_line_map, filename = 'figures/ais_lines_2017-01-25.png', device="png", height = 5, width=4) # That's not working - there's something about the data that isn't working somehow.

# Now we can see all of the ships that entered this right whale critical habitat during the heart of calving season (January). We can use the sf + dplyr packages to ask really simple questions like:

# - how many ships entered the critical habitat on 2017-01-25?
# - what are the lengths (in feet) of ships that entered the habitat?
# - what is the total length (in meters!) of ship tracks within the critical habitat on 2017-01-25?

# Compare 2017-01-25 ship tracks with NARW critical habitats

# Nope -- these packages must have been updated, I can't get these things to work. So -- I think this lesson is done, because I'm not going to be able to get this information.
